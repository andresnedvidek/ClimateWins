# ClimateWins Machine Learning predictions 

# Context:
In this project, I worked with a hypothetical organization called ClimateWins, a European nonprofit, to demonstrate my machine learning and data analytics skills. The project focuses on exploring both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to predict the impacts of climate change. Using real-world weather station data, I applied various models to uncover insights and make predictions about future weather patterns and environmental changes.

# Key Questions:

How can machine learning be applied to weather data to predict climate change effects?
What ethical concerns are associated with using machine learning for this project?
What have been the historical maximums and minimums in temperature?
Can machine learning predict favorable or dangerous weather conditions on a specific day?

● Finding new patterns in weather changes over the last 60 years.

● Identifying weather patterns outside the regional norm in Europe.

● Determining whether unusual weather patterns are increasing.

● Generating possibilities for future weather conditions over the next 25 to 50 years based
  on current trends.
  
● Determining the safest places for people to live in Europe within the next 25 to 50 years.

# ClimateWins: 
A Nonprofit organization interested in climate change predictions.
Data Analyst: Responsible for applying machine learning techniques and delivering insights.
European Climate Assessment & Data Set: Provides historical weather data.

# Skills being showcased:
For this project, Python was the primary programming language, and the focus was on leveraging powerful machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.
The following tools and techniques were applied:

● Machine Learning Models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).

● Data Scaling: Employed to enhance model accuracy and performance.

● Optimization: Used the Gradient Descent method to predict temperature trends.
