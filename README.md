# Objective:
Use machine learning to predict the consequences of climate change in Europe for ClimateWins, a nonprofit organization.

# Context:
ClimateWins, a European nonprofit, is exploring how machine learning can help predict climate change impacts, given its limited resources and need to integrate diverse data sources, including hurricane predictions, typhoon data, and world temperatures. Your role includes training in machine learning, identifying suitable models, and applying these models to make predictions.

# Key Questions:

How can machine learning be applied to weather data to predict climate change effects?
What ethical concerns are associated with using machine learning for this project?
What have been the historical maximums and minimums in temperature?
Can machine learning predict favorable or dangerous weather conditions on a specific day?
Stakeholders:

# ClimateWins: 
Nonprofit organization interested in climate change predictions.
Data Analyst (You): Responsible for applying machine learning techniques and delivering insights.
European Climate Assessment & Data Set: Provides historical weather data.
Data and Links:

# Data Set: 
Weather observations from 18 European weather stations, covering data from the late 1800s to 2022, including temperature, wind speed, snow, and global radiation.
